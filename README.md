## Introduction

Welcome to the data repository for the *Solenodon paradoxus* genome. See below for descriptions how to retrieve appropriate files in standard formats from public repositories.

## Publication

The data described below was published in the following paper. Please cite this publication when using these data.

Casewell et al. In Prep. XXX. XXX.

## Raw Sequencing Data

The raw sequence read data for this genome can be obtained from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under accession [XXX](www.google.com).

## Genome Assemblies

The raw genome assembly prior to NCBI submission can be found at Figshare under accession [XXX](www.google.com).

The genome assembly has also been accessioned through NCBI under accession [XXX](www.google.com).

Note: NCBI filters away contigs and scaffolds based on certain criteria, so differences in the assemblies will exist. Moreover, the genome annotation described in the above publication (see below) is based on the pre-NCBI genome assembly.

## Genome Annotation

Repeat and gene annotation files for the raw (pre-NCBI) genome assembly, which are described in the above publication, can be found at Figshare under accession [XXX](www.google.com). We have also created a [Genome Hub](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/hgTrackHubHelp.html) that can be accessed through the UCSC

NCBI also performs gene annotation via their [Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process/) and the resulting annotation can be found under accession [XXX](www.google.com).
